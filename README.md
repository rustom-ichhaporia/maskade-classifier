## Description

The Maskade Classifier is a lightweight computer vision project built with C++. It uses the user's camera to determine if they have a face mask for COVID-19 correctly placed on their face. It also features a minigame in which the user has to try to keep their face behind a floating digital mask to score points before time runs out. The name is a pun on cascade classifiers (e.g. the Haar Cascade Classifier), a common type of computer vision object detection model.
